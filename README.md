# arccw_exoticarmspack
A collection of little-known and rarely-seen guns from across the world, each with their own quirks and unique customization features. 
Take on the world and turn heads of gun enthusiasts with Exotic Arms.

Requires Arctic's Customizeable Weapons (ArcCW) base and Gunsmith Offensive (GSO) to work properly. 

May also require Counter-Strike+ (CS+) for certain weapons that don't have GSO-style bodygroups.
