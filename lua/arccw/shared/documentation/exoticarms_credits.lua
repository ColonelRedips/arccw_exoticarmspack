General:
Credit to Dr Gordon Freeman & Infinity ward for that drum mag you see on almost every gun.
Credit to Pavlienda for making the hand rig used to animate all the weapons.

Special thanks to everyone else who has helped make this pack a possibility, including:
    - rzen1th, who made some amazing sounds and fixed idle positions
    - slogkot/fleshy mammal, who lent me a few models from his FAS2 pack to use, gave me advice, and helped me improve as an animator
    - russianlad, who also helped me improve as an animator

And an extra special thanks to YOU for downloading this!
